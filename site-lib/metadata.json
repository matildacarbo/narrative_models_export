It sets a benchmark for studies with children. p.192-193:\nModels of narrative complexity developed in the 70s-80s. Narrative = setting + one or more episodes. Episode = initiating event + internal response + internal plan + attempt + direct consequence + reaction. An episode might not have all of these elements; episodes are more or less complex depending on the number of elements present. Stein &amp; Glenn's 1979 story grammar model is one of those models. It is still used in recent narrative research. p. 193:\nMAIN builds on these prior models. The model developed involves complete unites (episodes) that have 5 components. 2 of them (initiation, and reaction; internal states of the protagonist) frame the 3 components that form the core content of the episode: Goal, Attempt, Outcome. The narrative also needs a statement setting (time &amp; place) at the start. Research with MAIN can be qualitative or quantitative (p.193-194), and involves telling stories based on a set of images. The set was designed for broad cross-cultural appropriateness. p.204: Participants had similar production regardless of language groups. -&gt; \"This is good evidence for the pictorial stimuli being cross-linguistically and cross-culturally robust, at least for three groups of monolingual adults (all Europeans, and all literate)\" Imo it doesn't demonstrate appropriateness beyond Western cultures and languages. But then again, a lot of narrative research seems developed for use in evaluating students, educational needs &amp; language impairment; this creates a bias towards tools that are \"cross-cultural\" but only really need to be relevant for WEIRD populations, by which I mean industrialized/rich moreso than Western. p.204-205: \"story complexity was not found to differ significantly, neither between languages nor between stories (Baby Goats vs. Baby Birds). This finding suggests that story complexity (i.e. the qualitative evaluation of macrostructure) may be of a more universal nature than story structure.\" Complexity here was a matter of number of episodes with full Goal-Action-Outcome sequences. p.205-206:\nGoals are not always explicitly included in narratives of adult -- this creates a problem for the theory, because goals are seen as central to narratives, and their omission can't be attributed to the storytellers' low skills.\nThe authors resolve this by formulating alternatives to GAO. 1) IAO sequence (internal state as initiating event, attempt, outcome). 'Internal states' were included more frequently than Goals, and they can be the starting point of an episode. 2) EAO sequence (initiating event, attempt, outcome) ","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Monolingual research","level":1,"id":"Monolingual_research_0"},{"heading":"Background","level":1,"id":"Background_0"},{"heading":"Cultural variation","level":1,"id":"Cultural_variation_0"},{"heading":"Theory","level":1,"id":"Theory_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"article-notes/gagarina-et-al-2019.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1763732661495,"modifiedTime":1764340133112,"sourceSize":2853,"sourcePath":"Article notes/Gagarina et al 2019.md","exportPath":"article-notes/gagarina-et-al-2019.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":57,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"article-notes/nicolas-&-ntuli-2025.html":{"title":"Nicolas & Ntuli 2025","icon":"<span class=\"cm-iconize-icon\" aria-label=\"LiAlertCircle\" data-icon=\"LiAlertCircle\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"display: inline-flex; transform: translateY(13%);\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"16px\" height=\"16px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide-alert-circle\"><circle cx=\"12\" cy=\"12\" r=\"10\"></circle><line x1=\"12\" y1=\"8\" x2=\"12\" y2=\"12\"></line><line x1=\"12\" y1=\"16\" x2=\"12.01\" y2=\"16\"></line></svg></span>","description":"English, Sepitori, Sesotho etc.\nMultilingual participantsp.6-7\n\"The story is categorised into a macrostructure schema of the cartoon (Colletta et al., 2015).\" (list of macro-episodes after that)\n\"We utilised a multi-tier coding grid in ELAN1 to facilitate transcription and annotation, initially developed for the Colletta et al.

linguistics\ncross-cultural pragmatics; discourse studies (intersects with pragmatics); semantics\n(?information structure, Frame)\n(?dialogic/construction grammar -- probably not this project)\nThe narrative structure models I've studied so far seem very disconnected from recent theory.\nThe model we adopt has a direct impact on how narrative structures are annotated (categories, but more importantly process).\nI've started to read about pragmatics/semantics to pitch ideas for an updated model.Looking at how these models coded their data does not seem very useful to us; it's incompletely described, and it's not an example of good practices.\nI think a better alternative is to look into recent publications about best practices for linguistic annotation, like: Handbook of Linguistic Annotation (general reference; book)\nHoek &amp; Scholman 2017 (focuses on discourse; article)\nBest practices would impact the workflow, the labels used, and the description given in our writing.\nLearning about best practices can also be used to quality-check past annotations (&amp; correct/re-do, or just learn from it for future projects). Episode boundaries are sensitive to some types of expressions/functions; distribution is different at +start of ep VS -start of ep.\nThe forms populating the distribution are language-specific; so something like \"nouns are overrepresented at the start of ep\" is a falsified claim. That's true for some languages, and the opposite is true for others.\nWhat's comparable across languages is: that there are similar distribution patterns (pure stats) + that there's a shared set of \"types of expressions/functions sensitive to ep boundary\" + that it organizes around a binary (+- start of ep).\nTypes of expressions/functions sensitive to EP boundary\nWe can propose additions to the list of types of expressions/functions sensitive to ep boundary she presented.\nWe can reframe it more clearly with a split between function &amp; potential forms = semantics/pragmatics VS syntax/lexicon, roughly.\n(More speculative: maybe some elements ought to be removed from the inventory as spurious correlation that has to do with working memory.)\nJi 2002 identifies these variables as salient indicators of episode boundaries. Meaning, when given the task to place episode boundaries, research participants highly agree in case of (+) conditions, and agree a lot less in case of (-) conditions.\nThe study was conducted in just one language (English), but it builds an inventory of functions &amp; form types, rather than language-specific forms.\n+- Marked sentence\n+- Discontinuity in time, space\n+- Discontinuity in theme, if it has an additional feature: +- New participant\n+- Anaphor\n==(non-participant theme with no callback = adds little-to-no episode boundary salience, for example.) +- Major discontinuity (any type)\nI wonder why theme did not receive further, more precise split.\nAnaphor is significant beyond 'theme discontinuity'; most obviously 'referring expression (pron vs NP)'. Compare \"linking construction\".\n('Marked sentence' + Anaphor -&gt; information structure) linguaculture: \"culture manifested through language use\" (p.5) linguacultures vary within and between languages; the point of \"linguaculture\" is to make a small claim, connected to a community of practice speech acts: typology of speech acts from Edmondson &amp; House 1981 p.107\nthey warn against proliferation of new types of speech act; better to identify subtypes than new types expression: \"lexical items of various complexity\" (p.73) tertium comparationis: \"A common quality in two entities to be compared, which is the basis of the comparison.\" (p.260); nb different types of stable variables possible principle of comparability standard situation: \"The notion of a standard situation involves participants’ rather fixed expectations and perceptions of social role.

(Seen in group 2 &amp; 3.)\n(p.1268) When new theme introduction starts a small unit (group 3), agreement drop is larger than when it \"initiates a larger unit\" (group 2). //No further explanation included; examples supporting the statement are on p.1267+1268. I think this is about shifting between episodes 'on same level' vs shifting between those 'on different levels'.// (p.1268) When the discontinuity (of any type; time-space-theme) is not major. (Author calls these \"local\".)\nSo, according to this study, the variables that make episode boundaries more or less salient are:\n+- Marked sentence\n+- Discontinuity in time, space\n+- Discontinuity in theme, only with additional features: +- New participant\n+- Anaphor\n(so non-participant theme with no callback = adds very little episode boundary salience, for example. NB Why not split Theme further &amp; more precisely? + Anaphor is meaningful for the structure beyond this, at minimum in terms of NP vs Pron, what else?) +- Major discontinuity (any type)\n//There's a lot to unpack re discontinuity of theme\nFirst: what's happening would be clearer with precise, labelled splitting of theme. The problem is how you do you split it, and how do you justify your split? I can think of: participant VS internal state VS dialogue VS packaged action/event.\nSecond: Anaphor is meaningful outside thematic discontinuity. Most obviously regarding NP/pronouns to refer to participants. Also in some cases of discontinuity in time or place (less sure about that). The problem is that switch between anaphor &amp; non-anaphor has multiple triggers (eg memory decay), and anaphor can be distant or local. Switches are a cue for ep boundary, yet there are switches within episodes, and non-switches across episodes.\n...

Better modeling can be achieved with a wider dataset (wider range of narratives, and of storytellers represented). (p.12) Implicit connection with lang acq (age variation) and variationist description (class, origin, race,... variation) This work models tellings of personal experiences by average speakers from diverse backgrounds.
